## Important Note

Since the video file is 50 MB in size (GitHub only allows up to 25 MB), a web compressor was used to reduce the size to 15 MB, and it was published in the repository to demonstrate the work. The Audacity file was not published in the repository because it is 185 MB in size and cannot be uploaded.

For this reason, the following link provides access to a OneDrive folder with no password or requirements to view the modified video file without a watermark, the original video, and the Audacity file. In this folder, the last modification date can be seen to demonstrate that no further changes were made.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to modify a trailer for a video game or movie that is about to be released using the Audacity software to alter the sound properties. The selected trailer is from the video game *Silent Hill 2 Remake*, produced by Konami, which according to the official website will be released on October 8, 2024 (https://www.konami.com/games/eu/es/topics/17896/).

The project aims to completely change the original meaning of the trailer. The story is transformed to narrate the life of a street vendor who, traumatized by the events of the first installment, decides to stop selling "mazamorra". The monsters that appear in the trailer are depicted as addicts to his "mazamorra", which the protagonist tries to defeat in order to free himself from his past. Through the modification of sounds and effects, the original trailer takes on a comedic and distorted tone, in contrast to the original narrative of horror and suffering.
